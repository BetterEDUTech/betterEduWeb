                How do you deal with your emotions? There are times when tension seems to follow you everywhere. It's easy to feel overburdened by the demands of school between papers and exams, picking a major, locating a part-time job, and social life. Join me every week as I discuss the benefits of walking for mental health.  The mental progress I made during my walks shouldnâ€™t come as a surprise; walking releases endorphins, chemicals in our brain that stimulate relaxation and improve our mood.
